                  <p><span>Scott Joplin</span>, called <strong>“King of Ragtime,”</strong> published the most successful of the early rags, “The Maple Leaf Rag,” in 1899. Joplin, who considered ragtime a permanent and serious branch of classical music, composed hundreds of short pieces, a set of études, and operas in the style. Other important performers were, in St. Louis, Louis Chauvin and Thomas M. Turpin (father of St. Louis ragtime) and, in New Orleans, Tony Jackson.</p>
                  <p><span>Scott Joplin</span>（1868-1917），美国作曲家、钢琴家，也是历史上不多见的黑人音乐家，被后世誉为<strong>拉格泰姆之王</strong>。乔普林出生于德克萨斯，父母加上两个哥哥都是吹拉弹唱样样精通，他也从小就表现出极高的音乐天分。野路子出身的他，直到能够独立登台演奏钢琴的时候，还不怎么识谱。话又说回来，爵士乐本身就是一种具有相当即兴演奏成分的音乐形式，乔普林就这样一边演出一边学习，逐渐将拉格泰姆发扬光大。</p>

                <h4>Maple Leaf Rag</h4>
                  <p>Scott Joplin’s “Maple Leaf Rag” was published in 1899 with a March Tempo. You can hear strong, steady chords in left-hand keeps the march beat going throughout the piece, while the right-hand plays a lively, syncopated melody against this steady beat. The sections are repeated in the usual pattern. The melody begins higher and moves down.</p>
                  <p>The impressive tempo and difficulty of the piece were his way of showing that ragtime was as legitimate as any other genre, regardless of its origins. Maple Leaf Rag is playful, fun, and yet oddly mature. The use of the lower notes against the high notes creates a contrast that feels like an adult borrowing childhood for a few moments. It makes me feel young again, and the fast-paced, quirky notes are a welcome break from the normal, more sober piano recital. I like this. This is why I say to people, tunes of the old days really do show intuition and good old-fashioned wisdom on how to play tunes.</p>
                  <p>《Maple Leaf Rag》写于1899年， 是他创作的第一首也是最负盛名的拉格泰姆。枫叶拉格的谱子，在出版的第一个10年，就卖出了几十万份的销量，这在那个年代，绝对可以挤进超级畅销书的行列。1917年Scott Joplin的去世实际上结束了拉格泰姆时代，上世纪30年代拉格泰姆基本上已经绝迹了，而《Maple Leaf Rag》却成为爵士乐的一个标杆，对于爵士钢琴家而言，录上一段枫叶几乎算的上是入行的标配。</p>

                    <p>        Max Morath (born October 1, 1926) is an American ragtime pianist, composer, actor, and author. He is best known for his piano playing and is referred to as &quot;Mr. Ragtime&quot;. He has been a touring performer as well as being variously a composer, recording artist, actor, playwright, and radio and television presenter. Rudi Blesh billed Morath as a &quot;one-man ragtime army&quot;.</p>
                    <p>        Light, delighting, possessing clear cascades, his version of the Maple Leaf Rag is actually my favorite,  which I hope to emulate.</p>
